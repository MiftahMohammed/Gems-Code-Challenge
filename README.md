# Gems-Code-Challenge
the code challenge of Engie GEMS - Applicant: MIFTAH Mohammed (https://www.linkedin.com/in/miftah-mohammed-b72bbb62/)

Environement:
The application is developed with .NET framework (7) with VS 2022.

Just a normal build and run. It can be run on IIS server and or IIS Express.

PS: 
- I add Swagger UI, to easily test the solution.
- I tried to keep it as simple as possible. Of course more implementations/improvement can be done at all levels.
- it can also be tested with postman, the url (localhost:8888/productionplan) (post method).
